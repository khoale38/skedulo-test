1.Github API:
 - Whole source code is in my-app
 - Setup with ```yarn add```
 - Run source code by: ```yarn start``` or access ```skedulo-test-seven.vercel.app``` for online version
 - Unit test is place in githubSlice.test.tsx
 - Run unit test by: ```yarn test```


2.Overlap:
 - Approach: Sort array by endPx -> Iterate through array -> Check for overlap and merge
